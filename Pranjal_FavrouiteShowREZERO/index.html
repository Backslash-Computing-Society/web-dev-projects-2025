  <h2>About Re:Zero - Starting Life in Another World</h2>
  <p>
    <em>Re:Zero - Starting Life in Another World</em> is a Japanese anime series blending <strong>fantasy</strong>,
    <strong>psychological drama</strong>, and <strong>emotional storytelling</strong> into a single, unforgettable journey.  
    The story follows <span style="font-weight:bold;">Subaru Natsuki</span>, an ordinary teenager suddenly
    transported from his everyday life into a mysterious realm filled with magic, spirits, and knights.
  </p>
  <p>
    At first, <span style="font-weight:bold;">Subaru</span> is thrilled—like any fan would be—to live in a fantasy world.
    But his excitement soon fades when he realizes this world is as dangerous as it is beautiful.  
    With no unique powers or guidance, he struggles to survive until he meets
    <span style="font-weight:bold;">Emilia</span>, a kindhearted half-elf girl with silver hair and a gentle soul,
    who is on her own important mission.
  </p>
  <p>
    When tragedy strikes, <span style="font-weight:bold;">Subaru</span> discovers a mysterious and cruel ability:
    whenever he dies, he returns to a fixed point in time, keeping all his memories but reliving the events again.  
    This power—known as <strong>Return by Death</strong>—becomes both his <em>greatest weapon</em> and his
    <em>deepest curse</em>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Each reset tests his determination, reshapes his relationships, and forces him to face his own weaknesses.
    <em>Re:Zero</em> stands out for its balance of heart-wrenching emotion, mystery, and hope—showing that even in despair,
    courage and compassion can change everything.
